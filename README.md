Hello! I'm Ana (she/her). ðŸ”§

I am a software developer + data person based in Madrid, Spain.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on recoding the printf function @ 42 && my first CTF Challenge @ INCIBE. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning @python and C.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me why my [get_next_line function](https://github.com/cortesana/get_next_line) reads The Lord of The Rings!
